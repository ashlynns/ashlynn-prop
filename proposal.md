# Bio 

My name is Ashlynn Steeves, I am a fourth year Biomedical Engineering student from the University of Victoria. I am working with the CFIA from September to December 2019 to complete my fourth and final co-op placement. 

During this placement I will be participating in the development of predictive genomics software, and the analyses of genome sequence data in support of the national brucellosis program.

# Background 

--- what is brucella? ---

Brucellosis is a disease caused by several species of the Brucella bacterium. It is chronic, contagious and a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread from animals to humans.

There are various types of brucellosis, including:

    Brucella abortus, which primarily affects cattle, bison and elk
    Brucella suis, which primarily affects swine
    Brucella melitensis, which primarily affects goats and sheep

--- why is it important? ---

In Canada, brucellosis is a disease that is readily controlled through current federal surveillance and eradication programs. However, the threat posed by brucellosis is still fairly wide spread. Its presence in bison in northern Alberta continues to pose significant risk to expansion of livestock (cattle and bison) operations and re-establishment of wood bison in the area. Furthermore, brucellosis is a concern in domestic cattle as an outbreak can result in significant economic losses. Finally, it is a potential human health risk, as humans can become infected by all types of brucellosis, resulting in a disease called undulant fever.

# Methods

# Expected results 

As a result of the work to be completed this term we expect to obtain a series of markers that can be used to identify different species of brucella. Such markers could be the persence of absense of a genomic region or single nucleotide varriants in shared genes. Ideally these markers would then be implemented in downstram tests such as PCR diagnostics and metagenomics.
